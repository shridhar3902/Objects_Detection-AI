# Objects_Detection-AI
This project implements an advanced Object Detection AI using Python, leveraging powerful deep learning frameworks like OpenCV, TensorFlow, and YOLO/SSD/Faster R-CNN. The model is capable of detecting and classifying multiple objects in real-time from images, videos, and live camera feeds.
